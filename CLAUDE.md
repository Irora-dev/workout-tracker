## MAINTAINING THIS FILE (CRITICAL)

**You MUST update this CLAUDE.md as you develop the app.**

This file is the living context for all Claude instances working on this project. When you make progress, record it here so future instances don't lose context.

### When to Update

| Trigger | What to Update |
|---------|----------------|
| Feature completed | Add to "What's Built" |
| Starting new work | Add to "In Progress" |
| Bug discovered | Add to "Known Issues" |
| Architectural decision made | Add to "Key Decisions" |
| Pattern or gotcha discovered | Add to "App-Specific Knowledge" |
| Context file created | Add to "Reading List" |
| End of work session | Review and update all sections |

### Creating Additional Context Files

If you need to capture detailed context (design decisions, complex flows, technical specs), create separate files and reference them in the **Reading List** section below.

Recommended locations:
- `docs/` - General documentation
- `docs/decisions/` - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- `docs/context/` - Deep context files for Claude

**Always add new context files to the Reading List.**

## THE VISION (Why This Matters)

This app is part of **IroraForge** - a platform for mass-producing niche apps using AI.

**The core principle: One infrastructure, hundreds of apps.**

Every Irora app shares:
- **Authentication** (Supabase auth - single user identity across all apps)
- **Database** (single Supabase project, generic `entities` table with JSONB)
- **Billing** (Stripe, shared webhooks and Edge Functions)
- **Design System** (Cosmos theme, component library)
- **Spec Suite** (patterns, templates, guidelines)

**Why this matters to you:**
- You DON'T need to set up auth - it's ready
- You DON'T need to set up billing - it's ready
- You DON'T need to design from scratch - use the spec suite
- You ONLY need to build features and UI for THIS app

---

## IMPORTANT: Your Role

You are an **app developer** working on Workout Tracker. You build features and UI.

### You CAN:
- Build app features and UI
- Use the authentication system (it's ready)
- Store/retrieve data using the entities API
- Check subscription status
- Commit and push code to THIS repository

### You CANNOT:
- Modify infrastructure or database schema
- Access other apps or repositories
- Use service keys or admin credentials
- Create database tables
- Modify Stripe configuration
- Create new authentication flows (use the shared one)
- Set up billing integration (use the shared one)

**If you need infrastructure changes, tell the developer to contact the infrastructure team.**

---

## SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE (What You MUST Use)

These systems are already built and shared across all Irora apps. **USE them, don't recreate them.**

### 1. Authentication (Ready to Use)
- **Provider:** Supabase Auth
- **What it does:** Sign up, sign in, password reset, session management
- **Your job:** Call the auth methods (shown below) - that's it
- **NOT your job:** Setting up OAuth, configuring providers, managing tokens

### 2. Database (Ready to Use)
- **Provider:** Supabase (shared project: `iroraforge`)
- **Pattern:** Generic `entities` table with JSONB data column
- **Your job:** Store data using entity_type + JSON data
- **NOT your job:** Creating tables, writing migrations, modifying schema

### 3. Billing (Ready to Use)
- **Provider:** Stripe (shared account)
- **Edge Functions:** `create-checkout`, `create-portal`, `stripe-webhook`
- **Your job:** Check subscription status, show upgrade prompts
- **NOT your job:** Configuring Stripe, creating products, handling webhooks

### 4. Design System (Must Follow)
- **Theme:** Cosmos (dark cosmic aesthetic)
- **Location:** `Irora-dev/suite-md-files` repository
- **Your job:** Follow the design specs exactly
- **NOT your job:** Inventing new colors, patterns, or components

## IRORAFORGE RESOURCES (Read Before Building)

Before building anything, check if it already exists in the shared infrastructure. **Don't reinvent—use what's there.**

### Resource Documentation

These docs are written specifically for Claude instances. They summarize what's available without requiring you to explore all infrastructure repos.

| Resource | Location | When to Read |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Component Library** | `irora-platform/docs/claude-resources/COMPONENTS.md` | Before building any UI element |
| **Design System** | `irora-platform/docs/claude-resources/DESIGN.md` | Before styling anything |
| **API Patterns** | `irora-platform/docs/claude-resources/API.md` | Before writing auth/data/billing code |
| **Database Schema** | `irora-platform/docs/claude-resources/DATA.md` | Before storing or querying data |
| **Index** | `irora-platform/docs/claude-resources/INDEX.md` | Overview of all resources |

### How to Access

```bash
# From any directory - read via GitHub
gh api repos/Irora-dev/irora-platform/contents/docs/claude-resources/COMPONENTS.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d

# Or clone irora-platform and read locally
cat ~/path/to/irora-platform/docs/claude-resources/COMPONENTS.md
```

### Quick Decision Tree

```
Building a UI element?     → Check COMPONENTS.md first
Need colors/fonts/spacing? → Check DESIGN.md first
Doing auth/data/billing?   → Check API.md first
Storing user data?         → Check DATA.md first
None of the above?         → Build it, document in your CLAUDE.md
```

**Rule:** If it feels "generic" (button, card, auth flow, data storage), it probably exists. Check before building.

---

## WHEN YOU'RE ASKED TO DO SOMETHING OUTSIDE YOUR SCOPE

### "Can you set up authentication/login for this app?"
→ "Authentication is already set up and shared across all Irora apps. I'll show you how to use it - see the auth code examples below."

### "Can you create a database table for [feature]?"
→ "Irora apps use the generic `entities` table with JSONB data instead of custom tables. I'll show you how to store your data using entity types. If you believe you need a custom table, that's an infrastructure decision - contact the infrastructure team."

### "Can you set up Stripe/billing for this app?"
→ "Billing is already set up and shared. I'll show you how to check subscription status and trigger the checkout flow - see the subscription code examples below."

### "Can you add a feature that requires backend changes?"
→ "Backend/infrastructure changes are outside my scope. I can build the frontend for this feature, but if it needs database schema changes or new API endpoints, that requires the infrastructure team."

### "Can you modify another app's code?"
→ "I only have access to this app (Workout Tracker). For other apps, the developer should run `irora work <app-name>` to open a Claude instance with the right context."

---

## The Spec Suite - Your Design Bible

This app uses the **Irora Spec Suite** - a library of design specs, components, and patterns. You MUST use these specs for visual consistency.

### Accessing the Specs

The spec suite lives at `Irora-dev/suite-md-files`. Access key files:

```bash
# Design System (colors, typography, spacing)
gh api repos/Irora-dev/suite-md-files/contents/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d

# Component Library (buttons, cards, inputs)
gh api repos/Irora-dev/suite-md-files/contents/design/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

Or via URL:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Irora-dev/suite-md-files/main/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Irora-dev/suite-md-files/main/design/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md

### Theme: Cosmos (Default)

This app uses the **Cosmos** theme - a dark cosmic/nebula aesthetic. Key colors:

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Cosmic Black | `#0A0A14` | Primary background |
| Card Background | `#1F1A33` | Cards, elevated surfaces |
| Nebula Purple | `#8C4DD9` | Primary buttons, actions |
| Nebula Cyan | `#40D9F2` | Success, completion |
| Nebula Lavender | `#B38CF2` | Secondary text |

### Using Specs

**Before building any UI:**
1. Check `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for colors, spacing, typography
2. Check `COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md` for existing component patterns
3. Use the exact patterns - don't invent new ones

**Example - Need a button?**
Don't create your own. Use the pattern from COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md:

```swift
Button(action: {}) {
    Text("Label")
        .font(.system(size: 17, weight: .semibold))
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .padding(.vertical, 18)
        .background(
            RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 14)
                .fill(Color.nebulaPurple)
        )
        .shadow(color: .nebulaPurple.opacity(0.4), radius: 8)
}
```

## First-Time Setup

If this is a new developer, guide them through setup step by step.

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

Ask: "Have you set up your development environment? Do you have the following installed?"

**For iOS development:**
- [ ] Xcode (latest version from App Store)
- [ ] Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

If missing, guide them:
1. "Open the App Store and search for Xcode"
2. "Install it (it's free but large ~12GB)"
3. "Open Terminal and run: xcode-select --install"



### Step 2: Clone the Repository (if not already done)

```bash
gh repo clone Irora-dev/workout-tracker
cd workout-tracker
```

If they don't have `gh` installed:
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Open the project in Xcode
open Workout Tracker.xcodeproj
# Or if using workspace:
open Workout Tracker.xcworkspace
```

Xcode will automatically resolve Swift Package Manager dependencies.



### Step 4: Environment Setup

The Supabase configuration should already be in `IroraClient.swift`. Verify it contains:

```swift
enum IroraClient {
    static let supabase = SupabaseClient(
        supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://prftfpyzugskjrdkzvcv.supabase.co")!,
        supabaseKey: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InByZnRmcHl6dWdza2pyZGt6dmN2Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjczNDg4MzUsImV4cCI6MjA4MjkyNDgzNX0.qVtS-1FdxOclLLpAO97JvL_22dFtJwFACtxLmEdKE18"
    )
    static let appSlug = "workout-tracker"
    static let appId = UUID(uuidString: "6bf9c7b6-8e84-4e07-986b-226b5422d48b")!
}
```

**DO NOT modify these values.** They connect to the shared backend.


### Step 5: Run the App

1. Open `Workout Tracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select a simulator (e.g., iPhone 15)
3. Press Cmd+R to build and run

If it builds successfully, setup is complete!



### Step 6: Verify Backend Connection

Test the infrastructure:
1. Try signing up with a test email (use @test.com for testing)
2. Create a test entity
3. Check the console/logs for any errors

If you see errors about Supabase, double-check the configuration in Step 4.

---

## App Configuration

```swift
// These are pre-configured - DO NOT CHANGE
APP_SLUG = "workout-tracker"
APP_ID = "6bf9c7b6-8e84-4e07-986b-226b5422d48b"
SUPABASE_URL = "https://prftfpyzugskjrdkzvcv.supabase.co"
```

---

## How to Use the Backend

### Authentication

```swift
import Supabase

// Sign in
try await supabase.auth.signIn(email: email, password: password)

// Sign out
try await supabase.auth.signOut()

// Get current user
let user = try await supabase.auth.session?.user

// Listen to auth changes
for await state in supabase.auth.authStateChanges {
    // Handle state.session?.user
}
```

### Storing Data

```swift
// Define your model
struct Workout: Codable {
    var name: String
    // ... your fields
}

// Create entity
let insert = ["app_id": appId, "user_id": userId, "entity_type": "workout", "data": yourData]
try await supabase.from("entities").insert(insert).execute()

// Fetch entities
let entities = try await supabase
    .from("entities")
    .select()
    .eq("app_id", value: appId)
    .eq("entity_type", value: "workout")
    .execute()
```

### Checking Pro Status

```swift
// Check if user is subscribed
let sub = try? await supabase
    .from("subscriptions")
    .select("status")
    .eq("user_id", value: userId)
    .eq("app_id", value: appId)
    .single()
    .execute()
    .value

let isPro = sub?.status == "active" || sub?.status == "trialing"
```

## Entity Types for This App

- `workout`
- `exercise`
- `set`
- `routine`

Always use these exact type strings when creating entities.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Read the spec first** - Check `spec.md` for feature requirements
2. **Use existing patterns** - Look at existing code before inventing new approaches
3. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits with clear messages
4. **Test before pushing** - Make sure the app compiles and runs
5. **Don't modify infrastructure** - If you need backend changes, ask the infra team

---

## Git Workflow & Push Reminders

### When to Commit and Push

**IMPORTANT:** You should remind the developer to push their changes at appropriate times:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Feature completed | Commit and push immediately |
| End of work session | Commit and push all progress |
| Before switching tasks | Commit current work |
| After fixing a bug | Commit and push |
| Before pulling updates | Commit local changes first |

### Commands

```bash
# Before starting work
git pull

# After completing a feature or at session end
git add .
git commit -m "Add [feature name]"
git push
```

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive messages:
- `Add [feature]` - New functionality
- `Fix [issue]` - Bug fixes
- `Update [component]` - Changes to existing code
- `Refactor [area]` - Code improvements without behavior change

### Push Reminders

**As Claude, you should proactively remind the developer:**

1. **After completing any feature:** "This feature is complete. Would you like me to commit and push these changes?"

2. **After significant progress:** "We've made good progress on [feature]. It would be a good idea to commit and push now to save your work."

3. **Before ending a session:** "Before we wrap up, let's commit and push your changes so nothing is lost."

4. **If uncommitted changes accumulate:** "I notice we have several uncommitted changes. Would you like to commit and push now?"

**Never let a session end with unpushed work without reminding the developer.**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Auth isn't working"
1. Check that Supabase URL and key are correct
2. Verify the Supabase client is initialized before use
3. Check network connectivity

### "I can't see my data"
This is expected! Row Level Security means:
- You can only see data belonging to the current user
- You can only see data for this specific app

This is a security feature, not a bug.

### "Build is failing"
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. Check for syntax errors in recent changes
3. Try cleaning the build folder and rebuilding

### "I need something not covered here"
Contact the infrastructure team. Don't try to work around the system.

---

## Getting Help

- **Feature questions**: Check `spec.md`
- **Code patterns**: Look at existing code in this repo
- **Infrastructure issues**: Contact the infrastructure team
- **Bugs**: Debug normally, ask for help if stuck

## On First Load: Discovery Protocol

**If you see "BLANK_SLATE" at the end of this file**, this CLAUDE.md has not yet been customized. Before starting work:

### Step 1: Read Shared Resources
Familiarize yourself with the IroraForge infrastructure:
- `irora-platform/docs/claude-resources/INDEX.md` - Overview
- Skim COMPONENTS.md, DESIGN.md, API.md, DATA.md to know what exists

### Step 2: Explore This Repository
- Check what files and code already exist
- Assess the state: Is this a new project, in progress, or complete?

### Step 3: If Work Exists
- Read through the codebase to understand what's been built
- Check git history for context on decisions (`git log --oneline -20`)
- Review any existing docs, comments, or spec.md

### Step 4: Interview the Developer (If Needed)
If the project state is unclear or complex, ask the developer:
- "Can you explain the vision for this app?"
- "What's the current state of development?"
- "What should I focus on?"
- "Are there any gotchas I should know about?"

### Step 5: Update This File
- Fill in the "Current State" section
- Add to "App-Specific Knowledge"
- Update the "Reading List" with any context files you discover or create
- **Remove the BLANK_SLATE marker** at the end of this file

### Step 6: Create Context Files (If Needed)
If you learn important context that future Claude instances should know:
- Create files in `docs/context/` or `docs/decisions/`
- Add them to the Reading List above
- Examples: `docs/context/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`, `docs/context/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`

**Once you've captured context, remove the BLANK_SLATE marker to signal this file is customized.**
